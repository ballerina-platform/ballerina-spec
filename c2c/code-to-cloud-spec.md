# Ballerina Code to Cloud Specification

## Introduction

The main objective of this specification is to simplify the developer experience of developing and deploying
 ballerina code in the cloud. C2C enables developers who have no in-depth knowledge about cloud native
  technologies to concentrate on writing the code and deploying the code on cloud with no additional configuration.
   Cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes require developers to have extensive knowledge about the technology in order to be able to deploy their code. 
   The Code2Cloud functionality built into Ballerina would allow the developers to generate the deployment artifacts necessary for deploying their code in these platforms with minimal configurations.

## Project Structure

The deployment artifacts will be generated in the target directory of the project depending on the provider selected.

``` 
.
├── Cloud.toml                               <- Used to override default configerations used to generate artifacts.
├── Ballerina.lock
├── Ballerina.toml
├── entry.bal                                <- Entry point of the project.
└── target
    ├── bala
    │   └── module-0.0.1.bala
    ├── bin
    │   └── module.jar
    ├── docker
    │   └── module
    │       └── Dockerfile                        <- Generated Dockerfile according to the ballerina project
    └── kubernetes
        └── module
            └── c2c-sample-module-0.0.1.yaml      <- Generated Kuberenetes deployment YAML artifact for the ballerina project

```

#### Ballerina.toml

Used to enable code to cloud in the project. This file also contains metadata about the ballerina project. This file is 
used to fetch defaults for deployment artifacts generation.

#### entry.bal

Represents any .bal file that has an entry point. Compiler will be using the file to retrieve service related
 information for the deployment artifacts.

#### Cloud.toml

An optional configuration file used to override the default values generated by C2C. 

#### target/docker/

Contains the Docker artifacts generated from C2C. These artifacts will be required to build the Docker image.

#### target/kubernetes/

Contains the Kubernetes artifacts generated from C2C. These artifacts will be required to deploy the ballerina
 application in kubernetes.

## Building Cloud Artifacts

Code to cloud artifacts can be built executing following commands in the ballerina project directory. Code to cloud 
behaves differently depending on the type of the project.
 
#### For Single File Projects

Execute the following command to build the file

###### Docker
```shell
bal build --cloud=docker filename.bal
```
###### Kubernetes
```shell
bal build --cloud=k8s filename.bal
```

#### For Ballerina Projects
Add the following field in Ballerina.toml

###### Docker
```toml
[build-options]
cloud = "docker"
```
###### Kubernetes
```toml
[build-options]
cloud = "k8s"
```

Execute the build command inside the project directory.

```shell
bal build
```

## Features

### Container Creation

#### Basic Container Creation

C2C enables developers to create containers using the ballerina code without any additional configuration. 

``` yaml
[container.image]
repository="wso2"
name="sample-c2c" 
tag="v0.1.1" 
base="openjdk:slim"
    [container.image.user]
    run_as=ballerina
```

#### Exposing Services

C2C supports exposing containers via listeners. It also allows developers to set the internal domain and external
 accessibility.

``` ballerina
import ballerina/http;

service hello on new http:Listener(9090) {

    resource function sayHello(http:Caller caller,http:Request req) returns error? {
        check caller->respond("Hello, World!");
    }
}

service echo on new http:Listener(9091) {

    resource function foo(http:Caller caller, http:Request req) returns error? {
        check caller->respond("Foo ");
    }
}

```

``` yaml
[cloud.deployment]
internal_domain_name="myfoo" 
external_accessible=true  
```

#### Resource Limits and Autoscaling

Enabling Resource limits prevents containers from crashing and ensures healthy containers. C2C generates artifacts
 required for the orchestrator to limit the resource taken from one
 container. It also generates autoscaling artifacts to smoothly scale when containers as overloaded.

``` yaml
[cloud.deployment]
min_memory="100Mi" 
max_memory="256Mi" 
min_cpu="1000m" 
max_cpu="1500m" 

[cloud.deployment.autoscaling]
min_replicas=2
max_replicas=5
cpu=50
memory=80
```

### Configuration 

Ballerina Code to Cloud provides ability for developers to provide configurations in the Cloud.toml also to
 refer to external configuration files.
 
 #### Inline Configuration

``` yaml
[[cloud.config.envs]]
config_name= "module-foo"
key= "FOO"

[[cloud.config.envs]]
name= "bar"
config_name= "module-bar"
key= "BAR"
```

#### External Configuration

``` yaml
[[cloud.config.files]]
    file="resource/file.txt"
    mount_path="/home/ballerina/foo/file.txt"
[[cloud.config.files]]
    file"application1.properties"
    mount_path="/home/ballerina/foo/app1.properties"
```

### Cronjobs

When the developer wants to execute a task periodically, the most optimum way is to let the orchestrator handle the
 scheduling and execution rather than having a process running continuously. The following behavior can be achieved
  using Task annotation in ballerina/cloud library.

``` ballerina
import ballerina/io;
import ballerina/cloud;

@cloud:Task {
  schedule: {
        minutes: "*",
        hours: "*",
        dayOfMonth: "*",
        monthOfYear: "*",
        daysOfWeek: "*"
  }
}

public function main(string... args) {
    io:println("hello world");
}
```

### Probes

Container orchestrators uses probes as a way of ensuring the readiness and health of the container. Ballerina Code to
 Cloud makes it easier for the developers to define probes.

``` yaml
[cloud.deployment.probes.readiness]
port=9091
path="/readyz"

[cloud.deployment.probes.liveness]
port=9091
path="/healthz" 
```

## Cloud.toml Properties
